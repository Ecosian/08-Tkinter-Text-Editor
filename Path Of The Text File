Respected Mrs Morrison,

In the school there has been many issues related to bullying, verbally and physically. This letter will inform you about everything happening in the school and therefore it needs serious attention. I have been studying at Notre Dame for 6 years and I am dissatisfied by the behaviour of older students.
